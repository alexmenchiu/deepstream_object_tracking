Prequisites:
- DeepStreamSDK 5.0
- Python 3.10
- Gst-python 1.0

To run the test app:
  $ python3 deepstream_test_1.py <h264_elementary_stream>

This document shall describe the sample deepstream-test1 application.

This application creates a pipeline that uses "nvinfer" element. Instance of
the "nvinfer" uses TensorRT API to execute inferencing on a model. Using a
correct configuration for a nvinfer element instance is therefore very
important as considerable behaviors of the instance are parameterized
through these configs.

For reference, here are the config files used for this sample :
1. The 3class detector  uses
    config.txt
